    <p>Hello <span>{{ user_name }}</span>,</p>

    <p>We have now unpublished the Intra page you have published or where you are marked as an information owner.
        The content was not updated within the previous 12 months.
        If the page is still needed, you can find it in an unpublished mode in the Intra publishing platform
        until <span>{{ entity_delete_date }}</span>.
        The page can be published again during that timeframe.</p>

    <p>Follow the link(s) to review the pages:</p>
    {# @todo: Pages have been turned from array to class, test this. #}
    <ul>
        {% for page in pages %}
            <li><a href="{{ page.url }}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">{{ page.title }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <p>Kind regards,</p>
    <p>Your Intra administrator</p>
