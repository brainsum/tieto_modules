    Hello {{ user_name }},

    If the pages are still needed, you can find it in an unpublished mode in the Intra publishing platform.
    The pages can be published again until the given dates.

    Follow the link(s) to review the pages:
    <ul>
        {% for page in pages %}
            <li>
                <a href="{{ page.url }}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">{{ page.title }}</a>
                <span class="entity-remove-date">Delete date: {{ page.deleteDate }}</span>
            </li>
